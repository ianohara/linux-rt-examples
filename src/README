Real Time Linux Example Code
============================
The code snippets here are meant to demonstrate using the different
Linux features required to write real time Linux applications.  Reading
through all of the code should give you a good start toward creating
successful realtime code.

Build and Install
-----------------
To build all of the code samples, just make:
  user$ make
There is no install rule, so you'll have to run them in place.
